#### Antibody Characterization Service

-   Affinity of protein-protein interactions; Antibody-antigen specificity and affinity: Real-time BLI-based (Bio-layer Interferometry) biophysical characterization of polyclonal and monoclonal antibody affinities (Kd) for antigen
    
-   Association and dissociation rates of protein-protein interactions: Quantification of  **K<sub>on</sub> and K<sub>off</sub> rates** for many antibody/antigen pairs underlying their dissociation constants
    
-   **Epitope binning** based upon antibody binding to non-overlapping epitopes
    
-   Antibody screening to reveal appropriate biophysical profiles for specific applications
    

With a wealth of knowledge on immunological interactions, we offer protein biophysical characterization services which can determine the kinetic characterization of protein-protein interactions. PBL offers biophysical characterization of antibody affinity for a ligand or the measurement of antigen:antibody K<sub>on</sub>/K<sub>off</sub> rates. To accelerate assay development, we also determine which antibodies bind to antigens in a sandwich format. Binning— determination of antibodies which bind to non-overlapping epitopes—is performed using multiple hybridoma clones.
