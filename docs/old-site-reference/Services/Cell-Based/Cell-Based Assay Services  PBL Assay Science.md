### Cytopathic Effect Inhibition Assay Service (CPE)

-   Widely accepted standard bioassay for determining the biological activity of interferons (IFNs)
    
-   More than **20 years of experience** serving Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, Contract Research, and Academic scientists
    
-   Services available for measurement of **IFN-Alpha**, **IFN-Beta**, **IFN-Omega**, **IFN-Gamma**, and **IFN-Lambda** bioactivity in human samples, in a variety of other species, and in **multiple matrices**
    

The standard bioassay used to determine the biological activity of interferon (IFN) encompasses measurement of the protection of cells from the cytopathic effect (CPE) of certain viruses. IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory activities. The biological activities of IFNs can be assessed by bioassay methods that quantify any of these characteristics. However, the standard IFN bioassay has been the protection of cells from CPE of certain viruses, since this was the initial activity which defined these molecules. CPE assay services may be used to measure the antiviral activity of IFN-α, β, ω, γ, and λ in human samples, as well as in a variety of other species, and in multiple matrices.  

##### Frequently used systems (high level of assay sensitivity and accuracy):

-   ##### \- Human A549 / EMCV 
    
-   ##### \- Bovine MDBK 
    
-   ##### \- Mouse L929 / VSV 
    

CPE assays are inherently complex due to the metabolic state of cells, virus replication, and the ability of IFN to protect cells. Our years of knowledge and expertise in CPE assays will reduce variability and provide you with reproducible quality results. 

Results are provided either as a graphical representation of dye binding which allows slope and parallel line analysis, or visually determined from microscopic examination of the CPE and determination of the dilution of test samples which protects 50% of the cells.
