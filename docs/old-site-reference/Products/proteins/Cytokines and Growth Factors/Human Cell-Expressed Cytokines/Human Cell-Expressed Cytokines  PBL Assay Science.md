-   Authentic human glycosylation & native human post-translational modifications
-   Animal-component-free, protein-free production
-   High bioactivity and stability; lyophilized
-   High purity, low endotoxin proteins (intrinsically low endotoxin levels conferred by human cell expression)

Human Cell Expressed (HCE) cytokines closely mimic native human proteins. These affordable, tag-free, animal-component-free proteins are produced in stable, serum-free, chemically defined cell culture helping ensure lot-to-lot consistency and reproducibility.

HCE cytokines possess authentic human N-and/or O-linked glycosylation and other post-translational modifications preserving appropriate biological activities and epitopes. These proteins retain native properties and accurately mimic native human proteins, providing researchers a useful tool to use in human cell culture experiments.
