Interferon Beta plays a pivotal role in the protective response to many infections and diseases due to its antiviral and immune-modulatory activities, and is an important early product of TLR/RLR stimulation. However, when produced unchecked it can also contribute to the generation of clinically relevant side effects and pathological processes. Additionally, IFN-β is a common therapeutic treatment for multiple sclerosis and some cancers with the research into these diseases often conducted in mice.
