This DIY ELISA is a Do-It-Yourself Development kit that contains the basic components necessary for the development of sandwich ELISAs to measure natural and recombinant Mouse IFN-Lambda 2/3 (IL-28A/38B). DIY kits are intended for the analysis of cell culture supernates. Other matrices need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. When used according to instructions and recommended materials, each DIY kit contains sufficient materials to develop approximately fifteen 96-well ELISA plates.
