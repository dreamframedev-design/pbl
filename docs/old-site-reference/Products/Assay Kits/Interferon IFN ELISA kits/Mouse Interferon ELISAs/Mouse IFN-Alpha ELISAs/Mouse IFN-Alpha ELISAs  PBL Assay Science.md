These **Mouse IFN-Alpha All-Subtype ELISA** kits are designed to provide **global IFN-Alpha subtype detection** (14 of 14). As multiple IFN-Alpha (IFNa, IFN-a) species are often present in biological samples, the ability to determine the total amount of IFN-Alpha subtypes is integral to a full understanding of IFN-Alpha's role within the immune system.
