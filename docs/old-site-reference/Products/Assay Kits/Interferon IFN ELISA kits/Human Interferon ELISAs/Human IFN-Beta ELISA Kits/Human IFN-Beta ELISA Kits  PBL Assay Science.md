These Human IFN-Beta ELISAs are highly sensitive immunoassays (< 3 pg/ml LLOQ) developed to measure human interferon beta (IFN-Beta) in specific matrices (e.g. healthy and disease sera, plasma, tissue culture media (TCM)). These high sensitivity assays display no inhibition of human IFN-Beta detection in the presence of 3-Log excess of soluble IFN-Alpha/Beta Receptor 2 (sIFNAR2) protein, thus measuring "total" IFN-Beta.
