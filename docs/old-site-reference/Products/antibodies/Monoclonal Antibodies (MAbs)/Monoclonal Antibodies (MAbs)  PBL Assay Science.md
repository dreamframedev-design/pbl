Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are often interchangeable; however in some applications, one or the other antibody will give a better result.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are monospecific antibodies that are the same because they are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. MAbs have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope and offer high specificity in applications such as **ELISA**, **flow cytometry** or **epitope mapping** where specific binding is desirable.

PBL's MAbs are derived against a range of interferons from various mammalian species. They deliver superior _product stability_ and _high specificity_ while providing _reliable_ and _reproducible results_.
