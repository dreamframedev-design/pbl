Polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) are obtained using a mixture of immunoglobulin molecules secreted against a specific antigen, each recognizing a different epitope making them more tolerant to small changes in the structure of the antigen. PAbs are preferable for neutralization because they target a variety of specific epitopes of a particular antigen.

PBL's PAbs are available for use in a range of applications including **ELISA**, **neutralization assays**, **western blotting**, **flow cytometry**, **immunoprecipitation**, and **immunohistochemistry**.
