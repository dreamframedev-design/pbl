The iLite Human Type I Interferon Responsive Cells are engineered cells optimized to express Firefly Luciferase under the control of an IFN a/b responsive promoter. IFN-Alpha or IFN-Beta binds to the IFN a/b receptor on the cell surface and activates the IFN a/b regulated Firefly Luciferase reporter gene construct. 

These growth-arrested cells are sensitive to human Type I IFN. The cells can be used in a number of different assays for measuring the bioactivity of Type I IFN or NAbs to IFN-Beta or NAbs to IFN-Alpha.

-   Provided as assay-ready frozen cells 
-   The cell line is highly specific for its target due to cell engineering using target-specific reporter gene constructs
