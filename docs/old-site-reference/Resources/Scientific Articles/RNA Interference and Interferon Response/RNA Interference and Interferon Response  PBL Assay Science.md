### 

RNAi is a naturally occuring process in which small RNA molecules activate a cellular process that results in the destruction of a specific mRNA.

**_RNA interference endogenous pathways_**

Endogenous RNAi pathways can be activated by double-stranded RNA of viruses (e.g. their replicative intermediate), transcripts from repetitive sequences in the host's genome, transposons, primary microRNA, and foreign DNA. The RNA polymerase II and III enzymes, Drosha and DICER, can cleave the double-stranded RNA and primary-miRNA (pri-RNA) and pre-miRNA into smaller pieces. Mature miRNA are usually 22 nt long. Double-stranded RNA of 30nt or longer usually induces interferon, which activates interferon response genes and proteins, a hallmark of the innate immune response.

**_Uses of shRNA, miRNA, siRNAs_**

Scientists use RNAi agents to probe gene function, such as genes involved in normal growth, maintenance, and repair processes; autoimmune diseases; viral replication; immune responses, and cancer.<sup>1-3</sup>

SiRNAs also are used to elucidate effector-mediator signal transduction pathways in normal cells, tumor cells, and chronic diseases <sup>2,4,5</sup> or elucidate genes modulated by the innate immune system in virally-infected cells or autoimmune diseases.<sup>5-7</sup>

SiRNA can help identify suitable targets for development of therapeutics,<sup>1,3,6</sup> assess the mechanism of various medications,<sup>3,8</sup> and be developed as novel therapeutics for pathogenic viruses, prions, and cancer.<sup>3,4,8-12</sup> 

**_Specificity_**

RNAi strategies depend on its sequence-specific binding to mRNA, thus forming double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). A major benefit of this antisense technology is its theoretical specificity.

However, siRNA can induce gene silencing or modulation of various off-target mRNAs with less than 100% homology by matching in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR).<sup>13</sup> The sense strand of the shRNA also causes off-target gene silencing.<sup>14</sup>

Since off-target mRNAs can differ between species,<sup>15</sup> off-target effects of a specific siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA in human cells or a clinical trial can not be predicted by pre-clinical rodent models.<sup>16</sup>

**_3 Distinct triggers of off-target effects_**

The introduction of siRNA, shRNA, or dual/triple miRNA constructs into cells may induce non-specific side effects by three separate origins:

-   Lipid-mediated effects
    
-   RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)-dependent off-target effects
    
-   Interferon response
    

SiRNA delivery with cationic lipids alters gene expression profiles of many genes, including interferon response genes.<sup>17</sup>  Some of these effects can be reduced by JAK inhibitors.<sup>17</sup>

Saturation of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with high quantities of shRNA driven by polymerase III transcription can induce off-target effects, such as cellular toxicity.<sup>18</sup> Switching to polymerase II-driven transcription in the vector lowers shRNA production which reduces toxicity.<sup>18</sup>

_**Five receptors detect RNA and induce type I interferon production**_

Exogenous RNA can trigger receptors involved in four distinct signaling pathways which induce the production of type I interferon (IFN).<sup>11</sup> Type I IFNs include IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ε, IFN-δ, IFN-τ, IFN-ζ, IFN-κ, IFN-ω, and IFN-ν.  The four distinct pathways are:

1.  Double-stand RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) pathway activates in the presence of long (>33bp) ds RNA in a non-sequence-specific fashion.
    
2.  Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3)-induced pathway is stimulated by dsRNA bound to TLR3.
    
3.  TLR7/ TLR8 –induced pathway is activated by synthetic nucleoside analogs, imidazoquinolines, and GU-rich short ssRNAs bound to the TLR7or TLR8 receptors.
    
4.  Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5)/ retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) pathway responds to dsRNAs, ssRNAs, siRNAs, and small-self RNAs. 
    
    1.  MDA5 detects long RNA molecules that are not mRNA nor ribosomal RNA.
        
    2.  The RIG-I recognizes the nascent 5’-triphosphate moiety of viral transcripts; the negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of viruses; short blunt-ended dsRNA of 21 nt long; RNase L-generated small-self RNAs; and dsRNAs of 300 to 1000 base pairs (bp).
        

Several miRNA can regulate IFN production, and IFN can regulate at least 36 distinct miRNA species.<sup>19</sup>

_Type I Interferon can act as a detrimental off-target effect, an adjuvant, or a confounding factor._ The siRNAs and the vectors may have intrinsic immunostimulatory activity<sup>11</sup> that affects the inflammatory status of the targeted tissue.

The RNAimmuno database stores a searchable list of published data on the effects of various siRNAs, miRNAs, vectors, and reagents on the innate immune response in vitro and in vivo.<sup>20</sup> 

**Off-target effect**:

Since interferon alpha can attenuate DICER-mediated processing of shRNA to siRNA but not siRNA-mediated knockdown of its target gene,<sup>21</sup> shRNA-induced IFN production may decrease the amount of siRNA in the cells. The lower siRNA quantity in the cells may limit its gene silencing ability.

Interferon also reduces the efficacy of oncolytic Semliki Forest Virus for the treatment of glioblastoma _in vitro_ and in mouse models.<sup>10</sup>

If siRNAs specific for overexpressed normal proteins in diseases also induce type I interferons, they can induce an inflammatory environment that may become detrimental. Various methods for reducing the siRNA-induced IFN production have been reported.<sup>11,22</sup>

**Potential adjuvant**:

SiRNAs and other antisense technology can reduce the replicative ability of prions,<sup>9</sup> and viral genomes such as Hepatitis C virus and HIV.<sup>4,12,23,24</sup>

**Confounding factor**:

SiRNA-based exploration of gene function can be complicated by siRNA’s immunostimulatory effects. Thus, numerous laboratories are reporting modifications to reduce siRNA’s effect on innate immune responses, as recently reviewed.<sup>11</sup>  Although siRNA screening may identify many genes that are false-positive molecular targets, SiRNA controls that distinguish between on-target and off-target gene silencing have been reported.<sup>27</sup>

As aforementioned, siRNA regulates off-target transcripts in a species-specific manner.<sup>15</sup> Thus, preclinical rodent models can not predict off-target effects of a specific siRNA, shRNA or miRNA in clinical trials.<sup>16</sup>

**Thus, monitoring of off-target activity such as interferon production concurrent with siRNA experimentation and development may help clarify the interpretation of your results.** Interferons (IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNγ) production can be efficiently and accurately monitored in plasma, culture supernatants, normal sera, and autoimmune serum <sup>1,6,8,28,29</sup> and CCL5<sup>29</sup> by ELISAs. The most commonly used assays are listed in Table 1. Purified IFNα or IFNβ from have been used as a standard in multiple assays for diverse species, including human,<sup>3</sup> macaques,<sup>24</sup> rodents (mouse, rat).<sup>31</sup>  For example, IFNα2 titrations are added as a standard in a functional interferon assay.<sup>32</sup> A purified IFN added to a cellular assay can confirm the biological actions of interferon on distinct pathways.<sup>5,7,23,31</sup>
