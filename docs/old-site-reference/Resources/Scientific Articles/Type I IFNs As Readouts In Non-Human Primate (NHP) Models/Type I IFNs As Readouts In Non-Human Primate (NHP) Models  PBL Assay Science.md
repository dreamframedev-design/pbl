**_Non-human primates in pre-clinical research_**

Two main species of non-human primates are used in the pre-clinical research setting: Cynomolgus (Macaca fascicularis) and Rhesus (Macaca mulatta) macaques. During the development of novel therapeutics for human diseases and infections, the majority of early research and development is performed in small animal models, such as rodents. However, inherent differences exist between rodent and human organs, tissues, and cellular components. Thus, to increase translatability of new therapeutics, the use of macaques is becoming a critical pre-clinical step and is useful for evaluating the dose requirements and toxicologic effects of biotherapeutics and pharmaceuticals. Due to their genetic and physiologic similarities with humans, macaques comprise a unique and highly relevant model organism for evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of novel therapeutics.

**_Toll-like Receptors and Type I Interferon_**

The ligation of host Toll-like receptors (TLRs) by bacterial and viral components results in production of type I interferons (IFNs) by many cell types, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells and macrophages. Type I IFNs (IFN-Alpha and -Beta) play pivotal roles in both protective and pathologic immunity. Clinically, maintenance of serum type I IFN levels within a range that is advantageous for limiting viral infections, while simultaneously avoiding the onset of autoimmunity, is crucial. Recently there has been a flurry of attempts to design next-level adjuvants that take advantage of nucleotide-sensing pathways to induce type I IFN and produce an enhanced immune response. In addition, for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), antagonists to TLRs 7 and 9 have been developed as novel therapeutics to dampen excessive IFN production. In contrast, TLR 7 and 9 agonists have been evaluated for their ability to induce IFN-Alpha and enhance protective immunity against Hepatitis C viral infections. Both of these strategies necessitate careful monitoring of IFN-Alpha levels to protect against the development of an immunocompromised state or other detrimental side effects. Therefore, use of pre-clinical macaque models affords the unique opportunity to test novel therapeutics for efficacy, potency, safety, toxicology, and off-target side effects prior to beginning Phase I trials in humans.

**_Therapeutics Targeting Type I IFNs and TLR Pathways_**

Some of the most exciting new drugs currently in development are small molecule agonists and antagonists of TLRs (Toll-Like Receptors). TLRs are highly conserved receptors of the innate immune system that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These short recognition sequences are found in bacterial and viral components ranging from bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and flagellin to double stranded RNA and unmethylated CpG DNA motifs. Ligation of the TLR receptors that bind dsRNA, LPS, ssRNA, or CpG DNA (TLRs 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9, respectively) initiates signaling cascades that culminate in the production of type I IFNs, such as IFN-Alpha and -Beta, as well as proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines<sup>3,4</sup> (Figure 1). Current studies are focused on the use of TLR antagonists for treatment of SLE and asthma<sup>5,6</sup>. Additionally, TLR agonists are readily being applied as adjuvants in a number of vaccine trials<sup>7</sup>. These include vaccines against viral diseases ranging from seasonal influenza<sup>8</sup> to HIV<sup>9</sup>, as well as for use in cancer vaccines<sup>10</sup>. Many TLR agonists and antagonists have progressed to clinical trial testing for safety and efficacy (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Because IFN-Alpha production is a major downstream readout indicative of TLR activation, it is frequently utilized in the research setting and in clinical trials as an indicator of TLR agonist potency _in vitro_ (tissue culture media) and _in vivo_ (serum or plasma). This is particularly true for studies on novel TLR-based therapies that employ or inhibit IFN-Alpha production as an intended component of their mechanisms of action. Of particular relevance are several preclinical studies and clinical trials involving novel therapeutic TLR7 agonists that induce IFN-Alpha to protect against Hepatitis C infections and TLR 7/8 antagonists that reduce IFN-Alpha levels for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis<sup>6, 7</sup>. In addition, an inhaled TLR7 agonist has been tested in **NHP**s and an inhaled TLR9 agonist has been found to be well tolerated in humans for treatment of allergic diseases including asthma. For formulations such as these that are designed for localized application, it is of central importance that serum biomarkers, including type I IFNs, be quantitated to assess any <u><a href="https://www.pblassaysci.com/technical-resources/rna-interference-and-interferon-response">off-target</a></u>, systemic inflammatory responses<sup>5,6</sup>.

**_Type I IFN and HIV/SIV_**

The relationship between IFN and HIV-1 infection is complex. Type I IFNs have been shown to inhibit replication of HIV-1 in cell culture and treatment of HIV-1 infected patients with type I IFN produces a marked, but transient, decrease in plasma viral load. However, in NHP models of SIV infection, which closely mimics HIV infection in humans, and during chronic HIV infection of humans, production of IFN and its downstream effects correlate with disease progression<sup>11</sup>. The reason for this remains unclear, and future study is warranted in order to aid in development of therapeutics. Acute production of IFN-Alpha following SIV infection of NHPs has been shown to be mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). It has been shown in other model systems that during the acute to chronic disease transition period, IFN-Alpha levels return to baseline. This shift in IFN production is believed to be due to activation-induced exhaustion of pDCs and subsequent increase in pre-DC precursors, which lack the ability to produce type I IFN<sup>12</sup>. 

**_NHP models of other viruses_**

Arguably, the most frequently utilized application of NHP models is for virology and vaccine studies. This is due to the ability of many human viruses to infect NHPs without the need for adaptation, and to the similarities in the immune response to viral infection. Viruses that have undergone testing in NHPs include Dengue, Ebola, Marburg, and West Nile<sup>18–20</sup>. It especially makes sense to use NHPs to study viruses that cause high fatality rates in humans, as vaccine efficacy cannot readily be tested without this model.

**_Summary_**

IFNs play a pivotal role not only in protective responses to many infections and diseases, but also in the generation of side effects and pathological sequelae when its production is unchecked. The ability to precisely quantify this family of cytokines in NHP is valuable not only in basic research but also for vaccine development and drug discovery. Accurate measurement of nonhuman primate IFN alpha and IFN-Beta in serum, plasma, and cell culture media by robust immunoassays such as PBL’s <u><a href="https://www.pblassaysci.com/assay-kits/cynomolgusrhesus-ifn-alpha-elisa-kit-serum-plasma-tcm-46100#tech-info-data">Cynomolgus IFN-Alpha</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.pblassaysci.com/assay-kits/cynomolgus-ifn-beta-elisa-kit-serum-plasma-tcm-46415#tech-info-data">Cynomolgus IFN-Beta</a></u> ELISAs would certainly enable NHP-based discoveries advance further.
