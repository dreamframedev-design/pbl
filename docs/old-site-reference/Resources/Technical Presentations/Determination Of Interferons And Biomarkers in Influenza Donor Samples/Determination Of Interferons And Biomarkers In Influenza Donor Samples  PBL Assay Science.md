_**Materials and Methods**_

Influenza and Healthy Donor sera were obtained from BioIVT and BioChemed. Both sources have IRB approval for biomarker studies. Samples were aliquoted and frozen on arrival, and no more than 1 additional freeze thaw was performed before biomarker interrogation. IFN-α (PBL [41115](https://www.pblassaysci.com/assay-kits/human-ifn-alpha-all-subtype-elisa-kit-high-sensitivity-serum-tcm-41115)), IFN-β (PBL [41415](https://www.pblassaysci.com/assay-kits/human-ifn-beta-elisa-kit-high-sensitivity-serum-plasma-tcm-41415)), IFN-γ (MSD K151QOD) Neopterin (IBL RE59321), and Beta 2-Microglobulin (R&D KGE019) were measured by singleplex ELISA. IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ω, IFN-γ, IFN-λ, IL-1α, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL-10 were measured by a plate based chemiluminescent multiplex assay (PBL [51500](https://www.pblassaysci.com/sample-testing-services)). IFN-γ, IL-1β, Il-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, CXCL-10, and TNF-α were analyzed through electrochemiluminescent multiplex assay (MSD K15049D and K15047D). All commercial assays were run by the manufacturers’ protocols. IFN-ω immunoassay was developed using 2 monoclonal antibodies from Thermo-Fisher on the Simoa© platform using the homebrew assay development kit (Quanterix). The sensitivity of the final assay was 0.06 pg/ml.

_**Statistical Analysis**_

Donor classes (Healthy and Influenza) were defined based on the clinical diagnosis of disease state. Samples displaying a concentration below the analytical sensitivity of a given assay were assigned a corrected value based on the manufacturer’s limit of detection claim. Biomarker populations were compared between stratified groups by Mann-Whitney U-Test. Correlations between different biomarker distributions for the Influenza cohort were compared under Spearman conditions and excluded samples which exhibited a double negative result on the respective assays. An alpha value of 0.05 was assigned during all statistical analysis to demarcate statistical significance.

_**Study Interpretations**_

Upregulation between Type I and II Interferons (IFN-α, β, γ, and ω) are prevalent and well-correlated during the incidence of Influenza. CXCL-10, TNF-α, IL-10, and Neopterin levels trended positively against the combined Interferon Score. A larger Influenza cohort can provide greater interpretations towards clinical biomarker crosstalk and disease prominence.

_**Conclusions**_

-   IFN-Alpha and IFN-Omega are highly correlated in Influenza patient sera.
-   CXCL-10 correlates well with IFN-Score in Influenza.
-   Little or no IFN-Alpha, IFN-Beta, or IFN-Omega is detected in healthy donors.
-   Larger cohorts with more complete patient information should provide more robust results.
-   Initial small studies with Hepatitis B and C donors show no Type I IFN.
    -   Acute vs. chronic viral infection?
