Polyclonal Antibodies From Multiple Mammalian Species". Body copy:

“Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies are often interchangeable; however in

some applications, one or the other antibody will give a better result.

○ Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are monospecific antibodies that are the same

because they are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique

parent cell. MAbs have monovalent affinity, in that they bind to the same epitope

and offer high specificity in applications such as ELISA, flow cytometry or epitope

mapping where specific binding is desirable.

○

○ PBL's MAbs are derived against a range of interferons from various mammalian

species. They deliver superior product stability and high specificity while

providing reliable and reproducible results.”

○

○ Many of our proteins are sold as units of activity per vial instead of in units of

mass per vial (µg or mg). Each new lot of protein is tested internally using the

same bioassay to provide a valid activity comparison between lots. (ED50 is the

amount of protein required to elicit a 50% maximum response in the bioassay.)

biologically relevant.”

■ Affinity of protein-protein interactions; Antibody-antigen

specificity and affinity: Real-time BLI-based (Bio-layer

Interferometry) biophysical characterization of polyclonal

and monoclonal antibody affinities (Kd) for antigen

■ Association and dissociation rates of protein-protein

interactions: Quantification of Kon and Koff rates for many

antibody/antigen pairs underlying their dissociation

constants

■ Epitope binning based upon antibody binding to

non-overlapping epitopes

■ Antibody screening to reveal appropriate biophysical

profiles for specific applications

With a wealth of knowledge on immunological interactions, we offer protein

biophysical characterization services which can determine the kinetic

characterization of protein-protein interactions. PBL offers biophysical

characterization of antibody affinity for a ligand or the measurement of

antigen:antibody Kon/Koff rates. To accelerate assay development, we also

determine which antibodies bind to antigens in a sandwich format. Binning—

determination of antibodies which bind to non-overlapping epitopes—is

performed using multiple hybridoma clones.

The graph shows the association and dissociation of IFN to a

surface-immobilized antibody as determined by real time Biolayer

Interferometry (BLI) using varying concentrations of IFN. The raw data is

shown in blue and the model response in red. IFN Binding to and Dissociation
